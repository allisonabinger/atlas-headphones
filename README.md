# Atlas - Headphones

## Intro
This project is an implementation of a web page from scratch (without any library) to utilize all of the HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive Design tools that I have learned so far at Atlas. The objective given is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

## Figma
The designer file that was used as reference can be found in the repository as source.fig
